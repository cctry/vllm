Two years after her move to San Francisco,[c] Riley, now 13, is about to enter high school. Her personified emotions — Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger and Disgust — have since overseen a newly-formed element of Riley's mind called her "Sense of Self", which houses memories and feelings that form Riley's beliefs. Joy, intending to fill the Sense of Self with only positive memories, has invented a mechanism that launches any negative memories to the back of Riley's mind. Riley and her best friends Bree and Grace are invited to a weekend ice hockey camp where Riley hopes to qualify for her school's team, the Firehawks. On the night before the camp, a "Puberty Alarm" sounds off, and a group of mind workers haphazardly upgrade the emotion console, leaving Headquarters a mess.The emotions discover that Riley wildly overreacts to any inputs they make to the console. Four new emotions also arrive at Headquarters and introduce themselves: Anxiety, Envy, Embarrassment, and Ennui. Though initially friendly, the new and old emotions clash over their approaches. In particular, Joy thinks Riley should focus on having fun at the camp, while Anxiety wants Riley to win a spot on the team and make new friends, especially after learning that Bree and Grace will be attending a different high school.While being led by Joy, Riley inadvertently causes the campers to be collectively punished by the camp's strict director, Coach Roberts. Feeling that Riley needs to change her personality to fit in with the older players, Anxiety dumps the Sense of Self into the back of Riley's mind and has the old emotions captured and thrown into a memory vault. She and the other new emotions then use negative memories to create a new, anxiety-focused Sense of Self and encourage Riley to make friends with popular hockey player Val Ortiz, further straining her friendship with Bree and Grace. The old emotions escape the vault and split up; Sadness uses a recall tube to return to Headquarters while the others go to the back of Riley's mind to retrieve her old Sense of Self.After Riley sneaks into Coach Roberts' office and discovers from Roberts' notebook that she does not consider Riley ready to become a Firehawk, Anxiety determines to take further control. The old emotions make it to the back of Riley's mind and find a mountain of bad memories deposited by Joy's mechanism. They retrieve Riley's Sense of Self and, with no other way to get back in time, cause an avalanche of bad memories which carries them back to Headquarters where the memories spill into Riley's Sense of Self. Anxiety is shocked to discover that, despite her intentions, she has caused the new Sense of Self to evolve into one of self-doubt, leading to her frantically controlling Riley during a crucial hockey game. This results in Riley performing poorly and accidentally hurting Grace, getting her sent to the penalty box. Horrified, a frenzied Anxiety swarms the console in a blinding whirlwind, causing an overwhelmed Riley to suffer a panic attack.The old emotions finally return to Headquarters, and Joy convinces Anxiety that she does not need to make Riley change for her to have a better future. Anxiety relents and the original Sense of Self is reinstalled, but the attack persists. After the repentant Anxiety admits that she cannot determine who Riley is, Joy realizes that the same, likewise, applies to her. She removes the first Sense of Self again, allowing a new, complex, and varying Sense of Self to form from Riley's positive and negative memories. Together, the emotions accept and embrace this third Sense of Self, finally allowing Riley to calm down and reconcile with Bree and Grace. The console directly calls for Joy, who takes command and helps Riley happily finish the game.Riley becomes friends with Val and the other Firehawks at high school while staying true to herself and maintaining her friendship with Bree and Grace. Now living in peace, the first and second generations of emotions work together to protect Riley. Riley checks her phone to see if she was recruited into the Firehawks[d] and looks at herself in the mirror with a proud smile.
Development
After the success of Inside Out, the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2015, Entertainment Tonight and The Guardian considered a sequel to be "inevitable."[16][17][18] Inside Out director Pete Docter was germinating ideas for a sequel while the original film's nominations were unveiled at the 88th Academy Awards in January 2016.[19] Development on the story began in early 2020 and Pixar officially confirmed the sequel's development during the D23 Expo announcement in September 2022, with Amy Poehler coming on stage to discuss the film alongside Docter.[20] Kelsey Mann was announced as the director of the sequel (making it his feature directorial debut), with Mark Nielsen producing, while Meg LeFauve was announced to write the film's screenplay, returning from its predecessor.[21]

To utilize "truthful" worldbuilding, Mann used Docter's "five to 27 emotions" idea from the first film that he pitched during its production.[22] Mann's first pass included nine new emotions to make Joy feel overwhelmed with all the new emotions showing up, but felt that the story could not keep track with so many emotions taking the spotlight or not adding to the story, so after the first screening he decided to simplify the number. Among those emotions was Schadenfreude (having joy at someone's expense), Jealousy and Guilt, but the latter two influenced the film despite being removed, with Mann feeling that Envy could relate to Jealousy and how remnants of Guilt could be found within Anxiety's introduction, even giving Anxiety some of Guilt's baggage, which was inspired by that of Disneyland hotels.[23]

Research and writing
The production team frequently consulted author and clinical psychologist Lisa Damour and used her books as guidance on accurately portraying how teenagers' emotions change during puberty. Professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, Dacher Keltner, who helped on the first Inside Out, returned as a consultant as well. Keltner played a key role in selecting which emotions should be introduced in the story. A character based on the emotion of shame was intended to be a part of the film but was axed, in part due to Keltner contesting that shame was not an emotion.[24]

To assist with the development of the film, Pixar enlisted a group of nine teenagers, who were dubbed "Riley's Crew", to provide feedback on the film to ensure it accurately portrayed modern teenage life. Their input led to the inclusion of the emotion Nostalgia and influenced various scenes, including everyday elements of the emotions' lives and the transition from middle school to high school.[25][26] Nielsen and Mann were also inspired by their own daughters when crafting the film. As development on the story began during lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the two were able to gather personal research from studying their children, some of whom were Riley's age in the film. Their perspective as parents helped in shaping the film and characterizing the emotions, especially Joy.[24]

Initially, the plot of the film was to involve a talent show, but that idea ended up being scrapped. After about three test screenings, Nielsen, Mann, and LeFauve decided it was best to center the story on Riley playing hockey, as they felt it was a unique aspect of her character. The decision was also influenced by input Mann received from Turning Red director Domee Shi when he asked how to make the film unique from other teenage coming-of-age stories, including her own.[27] The scene where the old emotions are locked in a vault was originally longer but was trimmed down as several gags were cut out due to time constraints.[27]

Casting
Poehler accepted an offer of $5 million with lucrative bonuses to reprise her role as Joy from the first film. Phyllis Smith and Lewis Black also reprise their roles from the first film, voicing Sadness and Anger, respectively.[6] Following a dispute over pay, both Bill Hader and Mindy Kaling declined to reprise their respective roles as Fear and Disgust; they and the rest of the returning cast were reportedly offered $100,000 each, equivalent to two percent of Poehler's salary.[28] On November 9, 2023, with the release of the teaser trailer, it was revealed that Tony Hale and Liza Lapira would replace Hader and Kaling as Fear and Disgust, respectively, while Maya Hawke joined the cast as Anxiety, a new emotion.[5] Mann auditioned Hawke via Zoom at the office of a back room in Epcot during a family vacation with his kids after Nielsen told him that Hawke was available to audition just then, with her anxious performance driving him to tears.[29] On January 16, 2024, it was revealed that June Squibb had joined the cast in an undisclosed role,[13] later revealed to be Nostalgia.[12]

On March 7, 2024, Disney revealed that Ayo Edebiri, Adèle Exarchopoulos, Paul Walter Hauser, Kensington Tallman, Diane Lane, and Kyle MacLachlan joined the cast, with Edebiri, Exarchopoulos, and Hauser playing the other new emotions, Envy, Ennui, and Embarrassment, respectively.[6] In addition, Tallman replaces Kaitlyn Dias as Riley Andersen, while Lane reprises her role as Mrs. Andersen, and MacLachlan also reprises his role as Mr. Andersen.[6] John Ratzenberger reprises his role as Fritz, marking his first voice role in a Pixar film since Onward.[30] Also joining the cast in supporting roles are Lilimar, who plays a hockey player named Valentina, and Yvette Nicole Brown, who plays the coach of the hockey team, while Sumayyah Nuriddin-Green and Grace Lu play Bree and Grace, Riley's friends.[6][7]

Music
Main article: Inside Out 2 (soundtrack)
On March 7, 2024, with the release of the second trailer, it was reported that Andrea Datzman had composed the film's score, taking over for Michael Giacchino.[31] This made Datzman the first woman to score a Pixar feature film.[24][32] The soundtrack album was released by Walt Disney Records on June 14, 2024, the same day as the film.[33]

Release
Inside Out 2 premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on June 10, 2024,[34] and was released in theaters in the United States four days later.[20] It also screened at the 2024 Annecy International Animation Film Festival that same day.[35] The film was screened in various formats, including RealD 3D, IMAX and Dolby Cinema.[36]

Marketing
The teaser trailer for the film, along with the poster, was released on November 9, 2023. James Withbrook of Gizmodo and Inverse's Rotem Rusak highlighted the introduction of three other emotions in the poster: Embarrassment, Ennui, and Envy.[37][38] The teaser was viewed over 157 million times in the first 24 hours across all social media platforms—including over 78 million from TikTok—becoming the most-watched animated film trailer launch in the Walt Disney Company's history, surpassing the previous record holder, Frozen II (2019).[39] A clip from the film was also aired during the Super Bowl LVIII, named "Team".[40] The second trailer, along with a new poster, was released on March 7, 2024.[41] This trailer also marked the debut of the "standard" variant of the 2023 Walt Disney Pictures logo, which was introduced the year before for the studio's centennial anniversary.[42] The first 35 minutes of the film were screened during The Walt Disney Studios' presentation of first looks at their 2024 theatrical release slate at CinemaCon on April 11, 2024.[43] As part of a partnership with Airbnb, a new rental home in Nevada just outside of Las Vegas modeled after "headquarters" in the film was listed on the website beginning June 12, 2024.[44]

Reception
Box office
As of June 30, 2024, Inside Out 2 has grossed $469.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $545.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $1.015 billion.[3][4]

On a budget of $200 million, Inside Out 2 was initially projected to gross $80–90 million in its domestic opening weekend. The sub-$100 million industry projections were partially due to the notion that general audiences remained hesitant to return to theaters, given the direct-to-streaming releases of the Pixar films Soul (2020), Luca (2021), and Turning Red (2022) on Disney+, the underperformance of Pixar's Lightyear at the box office in 2022, and the lackluster box office results of several films in 2024.[2][45][46] After making $63.6 million on its first day,[47] including an estimated $13 million from Thursday night previews, projections were raised to $140–150 million for the weekend.[48] It ended up grossing $154.2 million domestically from 4,440 theaters and an estimated $140 million from 38 international markets, for a worldwide debut of $294.2 million, the highest in Pixar history.[49][50]

In the United States and Canada, the $154.2 million opening weekend was the best of 2024, surpassing Dune: Part Two ($82.5 million) and Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire ($80 million) to become the first film of the year to open above $100 million, and the third-best for an animated film behind Pixar's own Incredibles 2 (2018; $182.7 million) and Disney's The Lion King (2019; $191.7 million).[e] It was also the fourth-best opening for a PG film after The Lion King, Incredibles 2, and Beauty and the Beast ($174 million). With an average ticket price of $12.53 overall and $10.36 for children, twelve million moviegoers saw the film in its first weekend, nearing the thirteen million admissions for Barbie (2023) in its first three days. It played strongly throughout the day (22% of viewers attended before 1 pm, 35% between 1 pm and 5 pm, 26% between 5 pm and 8 pm, and 17% after 8 pm), benefiting from substantial walk-up business credited to its multi-cultural pull (of the opening weekend audience, 36% identified as Hispanic and Latino). IMAX and Premium Large Formats (PLFs) accounted for 43% of the earnings, while 14% came from 3D showings.[48][49][51] The film found momentum during the weekday, bringing its seven-day total to $255.2 million and reaching multiple box-office milestones,[54] including the second highest-grossing first Monday for a Pixar film (at $22.4 million),[55][56] the highest-grossing first Tuesday for an animated film (at $28.8 million),[57][58] the third highest non-opening Wednesday after Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015; $38 million) and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019; $32.2 million) that doubled as a record for the Juneteenth federal holiday since it began in 2021 (at $30.1 million),[59][60] and the highest-grossing first Thursday for a Pixar film (at $19.6 million).[61][62]

The film made $101.2 million in its second weekend, a mere 34.4% drop to become the most profitable second weekend for an animated film, surpassing the $92.3 million earned by The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023), and the seventh-best second weekend overall. Deadline Hollywood credited the feat to rainstorms and heat waves prompting people to visit air-conditioned theaters.[63][64] It beat newcomer A Quiet Place: Day One to remain at the top of the box office during its third weekend with $57.5 million.[65][66] On June 30, 2024, the film crossed the $1 billion threshold worldwide, being the first Disney animated film to do so since Frozen II in 2019. It holds the record for being the fastest animated film to cross $1 billion, doing so in 19 days, beating out The Lion King[f] (21days).[69]

Critical response
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 90% of 271 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The website's consensus reads: "Spicing things up with the wrinkle of teen angst, Inside Out 2 clears the head and warms the heart by living up to its predecessor's emotional intelligence."[70] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 73 out of 100, based on 59 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[71] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale (the same as the first film), while those surveyed by PostTrak gave the film an average of 4.5 out of 5 stars, with 71% saying they would definitely recommend it.[48]

Moira Macdonald of The Seattle Times awarded the film 3+1⁄2 stars out of four, commending the voice cast and the film as "a happy head trip, for any age."[72] Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph gave the film four stars out of five, praising the animation, metaphors, and wit while saying "the cast-iron ontological brilliance of Docter's original premise bears expansion well."[73] Owen Gleiberman of Variety praised Hawke's performance as Anxiety and the film's emotional impact, calling it "the most poignantly perceptive tale of the conundrums of early adolescence since Eighth Grade."[74] David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a 'C–' rating, writing that the film "so perfectly ticks Pixar's boxes in a way that forces the sincerity of its storytelling into a losing battle with the cynicism of its existence."[9]
